1. There will be 2 rounds. The 2nd round will consist of all the teams that made it to the top level in the 1st round.<br/>
2. The participants will register individually. We will form a team of 4 members with 1 member from each department.<br/>
3. Any random team may get caught into the blackhole.<br/>
4. Irrespective of the level that the team is on, if the team gets caught in a blackhole, they will have to solve the extra task and move ahead starting from the level they were on previously. <br/>
5. Use of lifts by any participant from the team will lead to disqualification of the entire team
