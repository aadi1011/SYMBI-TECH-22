<b>Robots per event:</b> 1<br/><br/>
<b>Robot specifications:</b> 2 ft. X 2 ft. (maximum)<br/>
<b>Max. weight of robot:</b> 3kg (Except batteries)<br/>
<b>Arena Length:</b> 30 meters long<br/><br/>
Time is measured from the second the robot crosses the starting line until the time it reaches the finish line.<br/> It is deemed to have crossed the line when the forward most wheel, track, or leg of the robot contacts or crosses over the line.<br/>
If the Robot crosses a checkpoint, and moves off track, then the Robot would be placed back on the previous checkpoint crossed. (Obstacles will be ramps, barricades etc.)<br/>
During the gameplay, if any part of a robot is destructed/ dismantled/ damaged the team will be given a timeout to repair at an expense of a penalty, while the next team will be called for play.<br/>
<br/>Only 1 timeout will be allowed per team.<br/>
